            <p>Here is a list of the logic flow</p>
            <hr>
            <ol>
                <li>Player Selects a Valid Piece (coded already)</li>
                <li>Player Selects a new location for said piece (partially coded)</li>
                <li>Move is validated based on team/piece (not coded yet)</li>
                <li>Perform a capture if necessary (nest in the move validator function)</li>
                <li>Move the actual piece (coded already)</li>
                <li>Determine weather a check/checkmate is reached</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <p>The function for check/checkmate has me a little puzzled but here is what I think so far. I think I can go one of two ways either way the function will be triggered after any time a piece is moved. that determines if any of the possible locations for that piece can intersect with the opposing king piece. The other way would be to have the king take on the role of every other piece and check if an opposing piece is in any valid position.</p>
            <p>I need to build a move validator function that determines if a move is valid or not I am thinking that the way I want to do this is with math, for instance say that the king is in row 6 column 4 which totals to 10. I have found that you can actually use that because a king can only move to a space in which the row/colum sum is + or - 1. I am sure that by using modulus division and other sorts of math tricks I will be able to create an algorithm for each case that will not be too intensively coded.</p>
            <p>For some of this I'm sure I will end up getting some brighter ideas from the internet but as of now this is purley my one line of thinking.</p>

            <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
            <p>If a pawn reaches the other side I will need to have the ability to swap it with another type of piece and then add that piece as a unique property to the team object.</p>
            <p>Every piece save for a Knight will require a clear path for all moves</p>
            <p>I will need to have a capture function (that I will probably call within the validator function when necessary) that changes object properties as needed.</p>
            <p>Player can't put their own King in check</p>
